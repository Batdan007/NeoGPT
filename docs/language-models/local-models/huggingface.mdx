Hugging Face is a popular open-source library. It provides a large number of pre-trained models for a variety of tasks. To use HuggingFace models with NeoGPT, you can run the following command:

```bash
python main.py --model hf/<model-name>
```

where `<model-name>` is the name of the model you want to use. For example, to use the `TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0` model, you can run:

```bash
python main.py --model hf/TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0
```

You can find a list of all available models [here](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation&sort=downloads).
