To use models from OpenAI, simply run the following command:

```bash
python main.py --model openai/<model-name>
```

This will default to `gpt-3.5-turbo`, which is mostly capable of generating responses to your prompts. If you want to use a different model, `gpt-4` or any other fine-tuned model, you can specify it using the `--model` flag:

```bash
python main.py --model openai/gpt-4
```

<Info>
Requires you to have an OpenAI API key. You can get one by signing up at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
